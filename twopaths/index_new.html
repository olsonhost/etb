                <p><strong>Educational Attainment (Bachelor's Degree or Higher)</strong></p>
                <p>The Facts Matter.</p>
                <p>Based on a review of public legislative biographies and independent legislative data:</p>
                <p>Approximately 4% of current Florida House members do not hold at least a bachelor's degree.</p>
                <p>About 96% do hold a bachelor's degree or higher.</p>
                <p>That means only a small minority of lawmakers fall outside the educational baseline held by nearly every other member of the Florida House.</p>
                <p>So Floridians should ask a simple question:</p>
                <p>Do we want Meg Weinberger - a member of that 4% - making complex policy decisions that directly impact Florida drivers, insurance costs, and access to medical care?</p>
                <p><strong>Our answer is no.</strong></p>
                <p>Florida drivers deserve lawmakers who are prepared, informed, and capable of understanding the real-world consequences of the laws they support - not political gamesmanship that puts families and premiums at risk.</p>
