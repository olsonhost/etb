Here’s the plain-English explanation of what the Weinberger / Grall PIP repeal bill (and related proposals) would mean
for Florida’s auto insurance system — and whether it would make Florida an “at-fault” state:

📌 What the bill is
• The legislative proposals (such as House Bill 769 / Senate Bill 522) by Rep. Meg Weinberger and Sen. Erin Grall would
repeal Florida’s no-fault/PIP auto insurance law and replace it with a more traditional fault-based insurance system.
• Under current Florida law, drivers buy Personal Injury Protection (PIP) coverage that pays certain medical costs
regardless of who was at fault in a crash.

📌 What the repeal would do
• Remove the mandatory PIP requirement: Drivers would no longer be required to carry PIP.
• Shift to fault-based liability: Bodily injury claims would be handled under traditional fault principles — meaning the
driver who caused the crash becomes responsible via liability coverage rather than just using their own PIP coverage.
• Bills propose higher minimum liability coverage (e.g., $25,000 per person / $50,000 per accident) instead of PIP.

🛠️ Does this make Florida an at-fault state?
Yes — if the bill were enacted in its current form. Repealing the no-fault/PIP scheme would replace it with a
fault-based insurance structure, where liability is determined based on who caused the accident and the responsible
driver’s liability coverage would be used to pay the other party’s damages. That’s a defining feature of at-fault
systems.

⚙️ Current status (as of late 2025)
• These bills (HB 769/SB 522) aim to transition Florida to at-fault, but as of now they have not become law.
• Previous similar repeal efforts (e.g., HB 1181, SB 1256 from earlier sessions) died in committee or were vetoed in past sessions.
• Even proponents and business groups differ on timing and details, and no final enacted repeal has occurred yet.

📌 What would change if enacted
• Car insurance requirements: Drivers could be required to carry fault-based bodily injury liability coverage instead of PIP.
• Claim process: Injured parties would generally have to establish fault in order to collect from the at-fault party’s insurer.
• Litigation risk: There would likely be more liability lawsuits, because PIP’s purpose of quick no-fault payouts would disappear.

🧠 Summary
Does the Weinberger/Grall PIP repeal bill make Florida an at-fault state? 
✔ Yes, that’s the intent: eliminate the current no-fault/PIP system and replace it with a fault-based insurance scheme. 
❌ Not yet in effect: the proposal has not become law, and previous attempts have stalled.
