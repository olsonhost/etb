Proposed Amendment — EMC Transparency and Accountability

Section X. Emergency Medical Condition Transparency Requirements

(1) Legislative Intent.
It is the intent of the Legislature to enhance transparency, integrity, and consumer confidence in Emergency Medical Condition (EMC) determinations made under Florida motor vehicle insurance law by requiring objective disclosure, independence, and public accountability without restricting access to medically necessary care.

(2) Written EMC Determination and Disclosure.
Any Emergency Medical Condition determination relied upon for purposes of benefit eligibility or reimbursement shall be documented in a written medical determination that includes:

(a) The clinical basis supporting the determination;
(b) The credentials and licensure of the evaluating medical professional;
(c) The date, modality, and method of evaluation, including whether the determination was made in person or via telemedicine; and
(d) A statement affirming compliance with the independence requirements of this section.

(3) Independence Requirement.
An EMC determination shall be made by a licensed medical professional who has no financial interest, referral relationship, or ownership interest with any treating provider, diagnostic entity, law firm, or insurer involved in the claim, other than compensation for the evaluation itself.

(4) Prohibition on Paper-Only Determinations.
An EMC determination may not be based solely on a paper or records review. The evaluating medical professional must conduct a direct patient evaluation, either in person or through synchronous telemedicine, consistent with applicable standards of care.

(5) Public Transparency and Consumer Access.
The Office of Insurance Regulation shall maintain or designate a publicly accessible transparency resource providing educational information regarding EMC determinations, consumer rights, evaluator independence standards, and complaint mechanisms.
Such resource shall be made available online and may be accessed at https://www.emctransparencybill.com or any successor site designated by the office.

(6) No Retroactive Justification.
Once an EMC determination is issued finding that a condition does not meet the statutory definition of an Emergency Medical Condition, such determination may not be retroactively altered or justified through subsequent documentation absent new clinical findings obtained through a qualifying medical evaluation.

(7) Enforcement.
Failure to comply with the transparency, independence, or disclosure requirements of this section shall render the EMC determination unenforceable for benefit eligibility or reimbursement purposes and may constitute grounds for administrative action as provided by law.

Plain-English Summary
This amendment ensures EMC determinations are real medical evaluations, not paperwork exercises; independent, not financially motivated; transparent, not hidden; and accessible to consumers through a publicly available resource at EMCTransparencyBill.com.
